### Overview
This project advocates for a shift in soil microbiome sampling from static spatial coverage to a dynamic philosophy of 'information discovery.' We propose a Bayesian Adaptive Sampling (BAS) framework that reframes sampling as a sequential decision-making process. By using probabilistic spatial models, BAS identifies the next optimal sampling locations to maximize scientific return while minimizing effort.
